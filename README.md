# Vitrivr NG

This directory contains the source code distribution of Vitrivr NG (stands for either 'Angular' or 'Next Generation'). It was created using [Angular](https://angular.io/)

Vitrivr NG is a web-based user interface developed to be used with the latest version if [Cineast](https://github.com/vitrivr/cineast). It allows the user to browse in and retrieve from mixed multimedia collections.

## Setup environment
For development, you will require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager. The Vitrivr NG project was created with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) so you need to install that as well. Once *npm* is available on your machine, you can install *Angular CLI* globally using the following command in your console:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

That's it. Now you should be ready to run Vitrivr NG!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
